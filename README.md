# Twitch Relay Bot!

Right now this is a fairly simple bot made to relay messages from Twitch to Discord and also the other way around.

## Usage

Change the configuration values in config.sample.json and duplicate it, renaming the duplicate to `config.json`. All the required configuration values are there, you must change them all in order for it to work.

### TMI Credentials

To get a Twitch Bot username/password you can use your own account, but I'd recommend creating another if you want a different username like `g33kbot` or whatever.

Just head to this website

### Discord Bot

Head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create an application, also you will need to make it a bot. Follow the step on that website to get a bot token.

## Known errors

- Errors when first starting sometimes not sending the Discord welcome message.

## Eventual Features

Other services like slack, mixer, etc.. And eventually will turn this into a hosted bot so you won't have to host it yourself and will only have to login and hook it up.
